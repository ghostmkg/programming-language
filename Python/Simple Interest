#Equation for simple interest is principle * time * rate)/100

#Defining the variables principle, time, rate based on the loan given to the user
p = input("What is the principle for your loan? ")
t = input("How much time do you get for your loan? ")
r = input("What is the rate of interest of your loan? ")

#Calculating simple interest using the formula/equation
s = (p * t * r)/100

#Displaying final simple interest of loan
print("The simple interest of your loan is " + s)
